                My coding journey
            </h3>
            <p class = "para font2" style = "font-size:20px;">
                In all the school years, I had chosen Physical Education instead of Computer Science so I was completely new to pretty much
                everything in programming. Took <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/">CS50P</a> course and completed it in August. Being a Harvard
                course, my Python and basic programming constructs became rock solid. From there, I am currently doing the <a href = "https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/">CS50x</a>
                course. Learnt C, SQL through it. Trying to understand HTML, CSS and Javascript through coding this website.

                I'm pretty good at photoshop, editing and taking photos in general is something I enjoy.  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/UxTwOPd"> Here's</a> a photo
                of Western Ghats I took on my flight from Mumbai to Bangalore.
